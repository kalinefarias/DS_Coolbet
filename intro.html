                        <h3>Welcome to Coolbet</h3>
                        <p>Coolbet, the B2C brand by GAN Ltd is an own-developed gaming site and sportsbook software.
                            Coolbet was launched in May 2016 and it has served over 700.000 unique customers. After
                            establishing a strong footprint in the Nordics (Norway, Sweden, Finland, Iceland and
                            Estonia), Coolbet also expanded to Canada, Chile, Ecuador and Peru. The Coolbet HQ is
                            located in Estonia with over 300 employees. In January 2021 Coolbet became a part of GAN
                            Limited, and is also referred to as Coolbet By Gan.</p>
                        <p>The success of Coolbet can be seen in the growth of the unique customers we serve nowadays in
                            9 different markets in Europe, Canada and Latin-America.
                            Coolbet is all about momentum and innovation, and that’s why we are strongly focused on
                            product development and setting new standards for responsible gaming. We work hard every day
                            to provide quality services, products, and, of course, execution.
                        </p>
                        <p>The name Coolbet was chosen for two reasons. Firstly, because it’s short and impossible to
                            forget. Secondly, because it represents our motto- “Stay Cool and Bet Responsibly”.</p>

                    <h4>Sportsbook</h4>
                    <div class="divider"></div>
                    <p>Coolbet is an independently developed and in-house sustained sportsbook platform. With unique
                        selling points such as top market payback on odds, transparency, and innovation, Coolbet
                        separates itself from the competition.
                    </p>
                    <p>Besides top odds, we also want to provide a top-class customer experience with a personalized
                        sportsbook lobby based on the customer betting history. Similar to companies such as Netflix and
                        Youtube, we offer our logged-in customers recommended betting markets. </p>
                    <p>Furthermore, we have numerous innovative features, such as 'incoming bets', 'betting performance
                        tracker' and 'bet upsell' feature, to name a few.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Casino</h4>
                    <div class="divider"></div>
                    <p>Coolbet casino strives to be fair, personal, and transparent with information that you will
                        rarely find on other gaming sites. USPs that make Coolbet stand out among many operators in the
                        field are features that have been built in-house such as RTP calculator, Casino filters,
                        Winners’ Feed & Payback Booster.
                    </p>
                    <p>Coolbet aims to improve the knowledge our customers have for online gaming. We will continue to
                        focus on product development and innovation and set new standards for transparency and
                        responsible gaming.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Poker</h4>
                    <div class="divider"></div>
                    <p>Coolbet is part of the iPoker network which is one of the largest poker networks in the world.
                        This gives the players a great poker offer and access to games around the clock and
                        state-of-the-art software. Besides having poker as a product, we also use poker for branding,
                        e.g. through our own live tournament Coolbet Open. With poker, we can incorporate the social
                        aspect of gaming and give the players unique experiences.
