                        <h3>Welcome to Coolbet</h3>
                        <p>Coolbet, the B2C brand by GAN Ltd is an own-developed gaming site and sportsbook software. Coolbet was launched in May 2016 and it has served over 700.000 unique customers. After establishing a strong footprint in the Nordics (Norway, Sweden, Finland, Iceland and Estonia), Coolbet also expanded to Canada, Chile, Ecuador and Peru. The Coolbet HQ is located in Estonia with over 300 employees. In January 2021 Coolbet became a part of GAN Limited, and is also referred to as Coolbet By Gan.</p>
                        <p>The success of Coolbet can be seen in the growth of the unique customers we serve nowadays in 9 different markets in Europe, Canada and Latin-America.</p>
                        <p>Coolbet is all about momentum and innovation, and that’s why we are strongly focused on product development and setting new standards for responsible gaming. We work hard every day to provide quality services, products, and, of course, execution.</p>
                        <p>The name Coolbet was chosen for two reasons. Firstly, because it’s short and impossible to forget. Secondly, because it represents our motto- “Stay Cool and Bet Responsibly”.</p>
